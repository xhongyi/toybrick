-----
This test was run where the read_idx was choosen randomly amoung 
all possible indices to create many cache misses. Furthermore, 
all bitvector computations were removed.

the following command was used to run the code

    >$ ./countPassFilter 3 < check0

passNum:        0
totalNum:       10125060
total_time: 5.720000
