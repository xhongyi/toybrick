-----
This test was run where the read_idx was choosen randomly amoung 
all possible indices to create many cache misses. Furthermore,
all memory accesses and bitvector computations were removed

the following command was used to run the code

    >$ ./countPassFilter 3 < check0

passNum:        0
totalNum:       10125060
total_time: 0.080000
