Description of files
-----------

* bar_plot-data.py
	Used to get information like the mean and %-speedup from data

* bar_plot.gp
	Gnuplot plotting file to make a simple bar plot

* bar_plot-plot.py
	Matplotlib plotting file used to make more complex plot

* bar_plot.py
	The plotting code called by the makefile. Make sure to cp or mv one of the other python plot files (bar_plot-data.py or bar_plot-plot.py) to this before trying to make

* bar_plot.tex
	Helper code to make latex plots with gnuplot

* compile_data.sh
	1 (of 2) data parsing scripts (the other is parse_data.py) used to combine data from multiple files into a wasily plottable format

* Makefile
	The file used the command make to compile documents. Be sure to cp or mv the correct Makefile (Makefile-gnuplot or Makefile-py) before running.

* Makefile-gnuplot
	The Makefile that is configured to create plots using gnuplot

* Makefile-py
	The Makefile configured to create plots using Matplotlib and python plotting scripts

* parse_data.py
	1 (of 2) data parsing scripts (the other is compile_data.sh) used to combine data from multiple files into a wasily plottable format

-----------
How to use
-----------

1) make sure that the following software are installed
   - LaTex
   - python + numpy + matplotlib
   - gnuplot (optional: only for plotting with gnuplot)

2) there are a few different Makefiles and bar_plot files. 
   - To plot using matplotlib

     >$ mv bar_plot-plot.py bar_plot.py
     >$ make # to compile the document

   - To plot using gnuplot rename Makefile-gnuplot to Makefile

     >$ mv Makefile-gnuplot Makefile
     >$ make
     
   - To get information like the mean and %-speedup 

     >$ mv bar_plot-data.py bar_plot.py
     >$ make

NOTE
----------
The code in thise directory is designed ONLY to plot the data in this directory. It is not designed to be multipurpose; nevertheless, it is relatively easy to configure
